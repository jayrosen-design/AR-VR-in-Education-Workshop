### Slide 38
![Slide 38](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AR-VR-in-Education/blob/main/slides/AR_VR%20in%20Ed%20ETC%20Workshop-%20Apr%2023%20(1)_Page_38.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
When you're starting to create an XR application, a fundamental question to keep in mind is: How will this medium (AR, VR, or MR) genuinely enhance the learning of a particular subject? It's not just about using new technology for its own sake, but about leveraging its unique capabilities to improve educational outcomes.

---
### Slide 39
![Slide 39](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AR-VR-in-Education/blob/main/slides/AR_VR%20in%20Ed%20ETC%20Workshop-%20Apr%2023%20(1)_Page_39.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Accessibility is a critical consideration. As a public institution, we must adhere to accessibility guidelines. This includes providing captions and audio descriptions, offering language options, and allowing for personalization. XR software presents unique challenges due to its reliance on camera movement and potential motion controls. Therefore, we need to consider what technology will be available to the audience, if certain movements are limited for users, and what kind of physical space is needed for the experience. The image shows an example from P.K. Yonge.

---
### Slide 40
![Slide 40](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AR-VR-in-Education/blob/main/slides/AR_VR%20in%20Ed%20ETC%20Workshop-%20Apr%2023%20(1)_Page_40.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Interaction methods are key to a good user experience. Everybody has an internalized perception of how to interact with things. For example, how would you mime taking a phone call or rolling down a car window? Where would you intuitively look for settings in an app or a login function? Standard user interface conventions are mostly based on 2D screens, so we need to thoughtfully adapt them for a 3D environment. The image shows a UI example for creating a game.

---
### Slide 41
![Slide 41](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AR-VR-in-Education/blob/main/slides/AR_VR%20in%20Ed%20ETC%20Workshop-%20Apr%2023%20(1)_Page_41.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
Consider the prime method of interaction for your XR application. Will users be tapping on a screen (common for mobile AR), using hand motion controls (like with Meta Quest controllers), pressing controller buttons, or will interaction be based on physical movement tracked by a camera, or even gaze-based eye tracking? It's best to focus on one or two primary interaction types to design the core gameplay or experience around. Examples shown are "Move the Void to Start!" and "Fruit Ninja VR."

### Slide 42
![Slide 42](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/AR-VR-in-Education/blob/main/slides/AR_VR%20in%20Ed%20ETC%20Workshop-%20Apr%2023%20(1)_Page_42.png?raw=true)
**Presenter Notes:**
We must also be mindful of technical limitations. These include the computing power of the target devices and user access to the necessary hardware. A significant concern, particularly for VR, is motion sickness. This can be caused by excessive peripheral motion, unexpected collisions in the virtual environment, screen effects like blurriness or chromatic aberration, and a lack of haptic feedback (like wind or vibrations) that would normally accompany movement.
